# My Awesome Project

Welcome to My Awesome Project! This is a brief README to get you started with the project and explain how to use Yarn as
the package manager.

## Installation

To get started, make sure you have Node.js and Yarn installed on your system. If you don't have Yarn, you can install it
by following the instructions at [Yarn Installation Guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/).

After you've installed Yarn, you can proceed with the project setup:

1. Install project dependencies using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

Usage
Now that you have the project set up, you can start using it:

1. Start the development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

1. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4000/docs.

2. You can make changes to the source code, and the development server will automatically reload the application.

3. To build a production-ready version of the project, run:

```bash
yarn build
```
